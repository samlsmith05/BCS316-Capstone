a) The script opens/creates the file written as invocation arguments. If more than one file is provided it opens the first one only. If that file does not exist, it creates it. If no file is written as an invocation argument, it creates newFile.txt.

b) All options work as far as I am aware

c) Everything works I believe

d) I added several subroutines to eliminate some redundant code.
